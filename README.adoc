= What is a microservices
image::file.png[]

Microservices are a software development technique
—a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) structural style—
that arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.
In a microservices architecture,
services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

= Containerization

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

= Service Discovery

Let’s imagine that you are writing some code that invokes a service that has a REST API or Thrift API. In order to make a request, your code needs to know the network location (IP address and port) of a service instance. In a traditional application running on physical hardware, the network locations of service instances are relatively static. For example, your code can read the network locations from a configuration file that is occasionally updated.

= Api Gateways

An API gateway takes all API calls from clients, then routes them to the appropriate microservice with request routing, composition, and protocol translation. Typically it handles a request by invoking multiple microservices and aggregating the results, to determine the best path. It can translate between web protocols and web‑unfriendly protocols that are used internally.

= Event Bus

Event driven architecture pattern is a distributed asynchronous architecture pattern to create highly scalable reactive applications. The pattern suits for on every level application stack from small to complex ones. The main idea is delivering and processing events asynchronously.

= Logging

Each service instance generates writes information about what it is doing to a log file in a standardized format. The log file contains errors, warnings, information and debug messages.
